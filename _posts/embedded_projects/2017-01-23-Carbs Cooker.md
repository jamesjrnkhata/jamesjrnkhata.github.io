This project aimed at developing a proof of concept (POC) for an all-in-one automatic cooker for three popular forms of carbs, these being Rice, Pasta and Nsima (Southern-African dish).

<h2 class="text-underline">Motivation</h2>

The incentive behind designing the Carb Cooker was to:
 1.	Simplify the process of determining the measurements required (water and uncooked rice, pasta or maize flour) to cook for a specific amount of people.
 2.	Automate the process of cooking each carb food type from adding the ingredients, heating and the timings required.
 3.	Automate the process of stirring the Nsima (which requires a lot of energy and skill to prevent the maize flour from forming lumps).

<h2 class="text-underline">Concept</h2>

<a class="custom_link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ugali">Nsima </a>is a type of maize flour porridge made in Africa. It is also known as **Ugali pap**, **Ngima**, **Obusuma**, **Kimnyet**, **Mieliepap**, **Nshima**, **Phutu**, **Sadza**, **Kwon**, and other names in other African countries. Process of cooking it may differ but It is cooked in boiling water or milk until it reaches a stiff or firm dough-like consistency.

 Rice, Pasta and Nsima all require different amounts of water, uncooked ingredients (raw rice, pasta and maize flour) and heating at various temperatures each with its own timings. Changes on the amount of water and timing can alter the resulting cooked productâ€™s either making it too soft, soggy or slightly hard.
