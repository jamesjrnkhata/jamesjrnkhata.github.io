<h2 class="text-underline">Challenge</h2>
The system was intended to be used for monitoring the soil moisture and autonomously watering the vegetables planted at an Allotment in a remote location. As the Allotment was in an area that was far from the owner's residence, access to water and electricity was not possible.  However a stream ran through the length of the Allotment which was decided to be used as the source for watering the vegetables using a Water Pump.

The challenges that the project potentially faced were:
* Power Source - Depending on the type of water pump used, a method of powering the pump was required.  
* Watering Control - A way to register when the ground was watered, when it needed watering and a method to start watering without the need for the user to visit the Allotment.
* Security of Equipment - Although the Allotment was in a gated area, further consideration was supposed to be taken for the security and protection of the components (pump, controller etc) as the Allotment was located in a public area surrounded by other Allotment owners. This would leave the components susceptible to theft, vandalism or weather.

### Power Source

In-order to power the system an off-grid power source was decided upon to be used for the Pump. This would include

* power source (autonomous off-grid system)

### Water Controller

### Security
