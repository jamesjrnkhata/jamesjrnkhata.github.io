The purpose of the study was to evaluate the accuracy of Augmented Reality Software Development Kit (SDK), **ARKit’s** *Ray-casting* as an approach to evaluate how far real-world objects are detected in an indoor environment.  The aim was to explore the feasibility of combining *Cloud computing* with **ARKit** *SDK’s* for the purpose of obstacle avoidance and navigation for the blind using an **iOS** (*Apple* mobile operating system) mobile device.   

<h2 class="text-underline">Methodology</h2>

Augmented Reality **ARKit** *Ray-Casting* is used to detect real-world objects and place *virtual Marker GameObjects* as way points for navigation in an **AR scene**. **Unity** *Physics Ray-Casting* is used to detect the user’s previously placed Markers while audio and vibration cues give information to the user to aid in navigating the environment. **Placenote’s** *Cloud-based mapping engine* is used to provide a consistent method to store the positons of Marker objects in the *AR rendered environment*. In similar, Monocular camera Depth estimation projects, methods have been used that involved image size ratio comparison upon movement, predictions based on semantic information and image to keyframe matching. Most related projects of mobile device navigation solutions have required external sensors, embedded beacon placement, pre-exiting building plans to familiarise the device to the environment.

<h2 class="text-underline">Implementation</h2>

The application was built using Unity editor 2019.1.8f1 to manage the user interface, custom Marker GameObject manipulation (creation and deletion) as well as integration with the ARKit and Placenote SDKs. ARKit 2.0 was used to add AR functionality to the application through Unity-ARKit-Plugin (only one compatible with Placenote as of the writing of this thesis). Placenote 1.6.12 was used to add Cloud-based mapping engine to the application. Apple’s voice-controlled voice assistant Siri [53] feature included with most post 12 October 2011 iOS devices was also an attractive feature to utilise for launching the augmented reality navigation for visually impaired application.
