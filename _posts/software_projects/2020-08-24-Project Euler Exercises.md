This project aims at attempting the coding problems set on https://projecteuler.net/ in-order to improve on problem solving and coding skills in C++.

<h2 class="text-underline">Problem 1</h2>

### Multiples of 3 and 5

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

### Solution
```cpp

```

<h2 class="text-underline">Problem 2</h2>

### Even Fibonacci numbers

Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:

1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...

By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

### Solution
```cpp

```

<h2 class="text-underline">Problem 4</h2>
### Largest palindrome product

A palindromic number reads the same both ways. The largest palindrome made from the product of two 2-digit numbers is 9009 = 91 × 99.

Find the largest palindrome made from the product of two 3-digit numbers.

### Solution
```cpp

```

<h2 class="text-underline">Problem 5</h2>

### Smallest multiple

2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.

What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?


### Solution
```cpp

```

<h2 class="text-underline">Problem 7</h2>

### 10001st prime

By listing the first six prime numbers: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13, we can see that the 6th prime is 13.

What is the 10 001st prime number?

### Solution
```cpp

```

<h2 class="text-underline">Problem 15</h2>

### Lattice paths

Starting in the top left corner of a 2×2 grid, and only being able to move to the right and down, there are exactly 6 routes to the bottom right corner.

<ul class="photo-gallery-2col">
  {% for image in page.images %}
    {% if image.weight == 1 %}
      <li>
        <figure class="custom-figure">
          <img src="{{ image.image_path }}" alt="{{ image.title }}">
          <figcaption class="custom-figcaption">
            {{ image.title }}
          </figcaption>
        </figure>  
      </li>
    {% endif %}  
  {% endfor %}  
</ul>

How many such routes are there through a 20×20 grid?


### Solution
```cpp

```


<h2 class="text-underline">Problem 67</h2>

### Maximum path sum II

By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.

3
7 4
2 4 6
8 5 9 3

That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.

Find the maximum total from top to bottom in triangle.txt (right click and 'Save Link/Target As...'), a 15K text file containing a triangle with one-hundred rows.


### Solution
```cpp

```
