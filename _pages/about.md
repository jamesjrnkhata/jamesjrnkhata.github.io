I am an Electronic and Computer Engineer who resides in Leicester, United Kingdom. My professional ambition is to continue developing in the dynamic industry of microelectronics, computing and Data Analysis to build a stronger base from the experience gained in both business and personal endeavours.

My interests involve keeping up-to-date with Consumer Electronics, Physical Fitness, Automation and Innovations in Renewable Energy.
